> **Stop manually checking flight prices every day.**  
> SkySaver watches flight routes for you 24/7, learns what a "normal" price looks like, and fires an alert the moment a genuinely good deal appears.

## 🤔 What Is SkySaver?

Imagine having a smart assistant that:
- **Checks flight prices** on your favourite routes every day, automatically
- **Remembers historical prices** and builds a picture of what's cheap vs expensive
- **Sends you an alert** only when the price is *genuinely* low — not just a random fluctuation
- **Never spams you** — it respects cooldown periods so you only get meaningful notifications
- **Predicts future prices** using a trained ML model so you know whether to book now or wait
- **Exposes a full REST API** — query prices, trigger scrapes, and manage alerts via HTTP

That's SkySaver. It's a Python-based backend system that runs quietly in the background, scrapes flight data from multiple sources, stores it in a database, uses smart statistics to decide when a price is worth your attention, and employs a ML Forecast Engine to score upcoming prices — all served through a production-ready FastAPI application.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔍 **Multi-Source Scraping** — Pulls prices from TinyFish (Google Flights + Skyscanner) and Amadeus API as a fallback
- 🧠 **Smart Alert Logic** — Only alerts when a price falls below the 10th percentile (bottom 10%) of historical prices for that route
- 🔄 **Auto Retry & Fallback** — If one data source fails or rate-limits, it automatically tries the next one
- 🛡️ **Rate Limit Protection** — Tracks daily API usage and enforces cooldowns so you never get banned
- 💾 **Persistent Memory** — All prices, stats, and alert history are saved in a local SQLite database
- 🤖 **AI-Powered** — Built on AG2 (AutoGen) framework with Google Gemini Flash/Pro and Claude Sonnet support
- 📊 **Price Statistics** — Calculates P10, P50, P90 percentile baselines per route automatically
- 📈 **ML Forecast Engine** — LightGBM-based model generates a `ForecastScore` with feature engineering and versioned model files
- 🔔 **Alert Engine** — Dedicated `AlertEngine` module evaluates `AlertDecision` objects and formats rich alert messages
- 🌐 **REST API** — Full FastAPI application with routes for scraping, prices, alerts, status, and health checks
- 🔐 **API Key Auth** — All protected endpoints require an `X-SkySaver-Key` header; `/health` is publicly accessible
- 🆔 **Request Tracing** — Every request gets a UUID4 `request_id` attached automatically via middleware
- 🧪 **Fully Tested** — Comprehensive pytest test suite covering all core logic, Phase 3 integration tests, and Phase 4 API tests

## 🗺️ How It Works — Simple Version

```
Every scheduled run:

1. 📋 Load all monitored flight routes from config
        ↓
2. ✈️  For each route + travel date:
        ↓
3. 🚦 Check rate limits (is it too soon to scrape this again?)
        ↓
4. 🌐 Fetch prices → TinyFish Browser → TinyFish Fetch → Amadeus (in that order)
        ↓
5. 🧹 Clean & normalise the data (remove duplicates, validate dates, parse prices)
        ↓
6. 💾 Save to database & update price statistics
        ↓
7. 📈 Run Forecast Engine → generate ForecastScore for the route
        ↓
8. 🔔 AlertEngine checks: Is today's price in the bottom 10% historically?
        ↓
9. 📊 Produce AnalysisReport with price trend + forecast summary
        ↓
10. 📣 YES → Fire alert! | NO → Sleep and try again next run
```

## 🌐 REST API

SkySaver exposes a full **FastAPI** application, served via Gunicorn in production.

### Authentication

All endpoints (except `/health`) require the `X-SkySaver-Key` header:

```
X-SkySaver-Key: your_api_key_here
```

### Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/health` | Liveness probe — no auth required |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/status` | Pipeline & system status |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/scrape/run` | Trigger a scrape run; returns `ScrapeRunResponse` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/prices` | Query stored price observations |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/routes` | List all monitored routes |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/routes` | Add a new route to monitor |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/alerts` | Query alert history |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/alerts/cooldown` | Check alert cooldown status |

### Running the API

```bash
# Development
uvicorn api.main:create_app --factory --reload

# Production (Gunicorn)
gunicorn -c gunicorn_conf.py "api.main:create_app()"
```

## 🗄️ Database Tables

SkySaver stores everything in a local **SQLite** database (no setup needed — it creates itself):

| Table | What's Stored |
|---|---|
| `monitored_routes` | Flight routes you want to track (e.g. BOM→DEL) |
| `price_observations` | Every single price data point ever collected |
| `price_stats` | Computed P10 / P50 / P90 baselines per route |
| `alert_log` | History of every alert ever fired (prevents spam) |
| `forecast_scores` | ML-generated ForecastScore records per route + date |

---

## 🔔 How the Alert System Works

SkySaver uses **percentile-based statistics** combined with the **AlertEngine** to make smart alert decisions — not simple price thresholds.

1. Every price observation is saved to the database
2. After enough data is collected, SkySaver computes the **P10 baseline** — the price below which only 10% of historical observations fall
3. When a new price comes in **below the P10**, `AlertEngine` evaluates the `AlertDecision` object
4. A cooldown check prevents duplicate alerts for the same route within a short period
5. If both checks pass → `AlertEngine` **fires the alert and formats the message** 🔔

> **In plain English:** If a flight normally costs ₹5,000–₹12,000 and today it's ₹3,800, SkySaver recognises that's in the bottom 10% of prices ever seen — and tells you immediately.

---

## 📈 Forecast Engine

The **ForecastEngine** uses a trained **LightGBM** model to predict whether a flight price is likely to rise or fall, giving you a `ForecastScore` alongside every alert.

- `build_features()` — Extracts time-series and route-based features from historical price data
- `generate_labels()` — Auto-labels training data (price went up / down) for supervised learning
- `_load_all_price_data()` — Reads the full observation history from SQLite for training
- **Versioned model files** — Each trained model is saved with a version number; `_latest_model_path()` always loads the most recent one
- `AnalysisReport` — The combined output of a full pipeline run: scrape results + alert decision + forecast score

---

## 🛡️ Rate Limiting — Staying Safe

SkySaver tracks every API call and enforces limits automatically:

- **Per-route cooldown** — Won't scrape the same route+date twice within a set interval
- **Daily TinyFish limits** — Separate counters for Browser and Fetch endpoints
- **Daily Amadeus limits** — Tracks usage and auto-resets at midnight UTC
- **JSON persistence** — Rate limit state survives restarts (saved to disk)
- **Thread-safe** — Multiple scraping threads won't corrupt the counters

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [x] **Phase 1** — Core scraping engine (TinyFish + Amadeus)
- [x] **Phase 2** — SQLite database + alert decision logic
- [x] **Phase 3** — Rate limiting + multi-source fallback + integration tests
- [x] **Phase 4** — ML price prediction with LightGBM (ForecastEngine) + FastAPI REST layer
- [ ] **Phase 5** — Telegram bot integration for real-time alerts
- [ ] **Phase 6** — Web dashboard for price history visualisation
