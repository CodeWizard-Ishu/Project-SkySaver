> **Stop manually checking flight prices every day.**  
> SkySaver watches flight routes for you 24/7, learns what a "normal" price looks like, and fires an alert the moment a genuinely good deal appears.

## 🤔 What Is SkySaver?

Imagine having a smart assistant that:
- **Checks flight prices** on your favourite routes every day, automatically
- **Remembers historical prices** and builds a picture of what's cheap vs expensive
- **Sends you an alert** only when the price is *genuinely* low — not just a random fluctuation
- **Never spams you** — it respects cooldown periods so you only get meaningful notifications

That's SkySaver. It's a Python-based backend system that runs quietly in the background, scrapes flight data from multiple sources, stores it in a database, and uses smart statistics to decide when a price is worth your attention.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔍 **Multi-Source Scraping** — Pulls prices from TinyFish (Google Flights + Skyscanner) and Amadeus API as a fallback
- 🧠 **Smart Alert Logic** — Only alerts when a price falls below the 10th percentile (bottom 10%) of historical prices for that route
- 🔄 **Auto Retry & Fallback** — If one data source fails or rate-limits, it automatically tries the next one
- 🛡️ **Rate Limit Protection** — Tracks daily API usage and enforces cooldowns so you never get banned
- 💾 **Persistent Memory** — All prices, stats, and alert history are saved in a local SQLite database
- 🤖 **AI-Powered** — Built on AG2 (AutoGen) framework with Google Gemini Flash/Pro and Claude Sonnet support
- 📊 **Price Statistics** — Calculates P10, P50, P90 percentile baselines per route automatically
- 🧪 **Fully Tested** — Comprehensive pytest test suite covering all core logic

## 🗺️ How It Works — Simple Version

```
Every scheduled run:

1. 📋 Load all monitored flight routes from config
        ↓
2. ✈️  For each route + travel date:
        ↓
3. 🚦 Check rate limits (is it too soon to scrape this again?)
        ↓
4. 🌐 Fetch prices → TinyFish Browser → TinyFish Fetch → Amadeus (in that order)
        ↓
5. 🧹 Clean & normalise the data (remove duplicates, validate dates, parse prices)
        ↓
6. 💾 Save to database & update price statistics
        ↓
7. 🔔 Check: Is today's price in the bottom 10% historically?
        ↓
8. 📣 YES → Fire alert! | NO → Sleep and try again next run
```

## 🧩 Core Components Explained

### For Non-Developers

| What It Does | The Component |
|---|---|
| 🎯 Coordinates the whole scraping run | **ScraperOrchestrator** |
| 🔎 Handles scraping for one specific route & date | **RouteScraperAgent** |
| 🌐 Gets prices from Google Flights / Skyscanner | **TinyFishClient** |
| ✈️ Gets prices from Amadeus (backup source) | **AmadeusClient** |
| 🚦 Makes sure we don't call APIs too often | **RateLimiter** |
| 🗃️ Stores and retrieves all price data | **SQLite Database** |
| 🔔 Decides if a price is good enough to alert | **Alert Engine** |

### For Developers

| Class / Module | File | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `ScraperOrchestrator` | `agents/scraper_agent.py` | Manages full scrape lifecycle across all routes |
| `RouteScraperAgent` | `agents/scraper_agent.py` | Single route scraper with priority-ordered multi-source fallback |
| `TinyFishClient` | `agents/scraper_agent.py` | Browser + Fetch API wrapper with per-endpoint retry logic |
| `AmadeusClient` | `agents/scraper_agent.py` | Amadeus SDK wrapper with error mapping and normalisation |
| `RateLimiter` | `agents/rate_limiter.py` | Thread-safe, JSON-persisted rate limiter for all APIs |
| `BaseAgent` | `agents/base_agent.py` | Logger, `.env` loader, Gemini/Claude config factory |
| `init_db` | `db/init_db.py` | Creates 5 DB tables + indexes, loads routes from YAML |
| `queries` | `db/queries.py` | All SQL: insert, update, alert decision, percentile computation |

---

## 🗄️ Database Tables

SkySaver stores everything in a local **SQLite** database (no setup needed — it creates itself):

| Table | What's Stored |
|---|---|
| `monitored_routes` | Flight routes you want to track (e.g. BOM→DEL) |
| `price_observations` | Every single price data point ever collected |
| `price_stats` | Computed P10 / P50 / P90 baselines per route |
| `alert_log` | History of every alert ever fired (prevents spam) |

---

## 🤖 AI & Tech Stack

SkySaver is built on the **AG2 (AutoGen)** AI agent framework and supports multiple AI models:

| Tool / Library | What It's Used For |
|---|---|
| `AG2 (AutoGen)` | Core AI agent framework |
| `Gemini Flash` | Fast, lightweight AI tasks |
| `Gemini Pro` | Advanced reasoning tasks |
| `Claude Sonnet` | Alternative LLM option |
| `Amadeus SDK` | Official flight data API |
| `TinyFish API` | Browser-based flight scraping |
| `SQLite` | Local database (zero config) |
| `Tenacity` | Automatic retry logic on failures |
| `FileLock` | Thread-safe file operations |
| `LightGBM + PyTorch` | ML price prediction *(Phase 4 — coming soon)* |

## 🔔 How the Alert System Works

SkySaver uses **percentile-based statistics** to make smart alert decisions — not simple price thresholds.

1. Every price observation is saved to the database
2. After enough data is collected, SkySaver computes the **P10 baseline** — the price below which only 10% of historical observations fall
3. When a new price comes in **below the P10**, it's considered a genuinely good deal
4. A cooldown check prevents duplicate alerts for the same route within a short period
5. If both checks pass → **Alert fires!** 🔔

> **In plain English:** If a flight normally costs ₹5,000–₹12,000 and today it's ₹3,800, SkySaver recognises that's in the bottom 10% of prices ever seen — and tells you immediately.

---

## 🛡️ Rate Limiting — Staying Safe

SkySaver tracks every API call and enforces limits automatically:

- **Per-route cooldown** — Won't scrape the same route+date twice within a set interval
- **Daily TinyFish limits** — Separate counters for Browser and Fetch endpoints
- **Daily Amadeus limits** — Tracks usage and auto-resets at midnight UTC
- **JSON persistence** — Rate limit state survives restarts (saved to disk)
- **Thread-safe** — Multiple scraping threads won't corrupt the counters

---

- [x] **Phase 2** — SQLite database + alert decision logic
- [x] **Phase 3** — Rate limiting + multi-source fallback
- [ ] **Phase 4** — ML price prediction with LightGBM + PyTorch
